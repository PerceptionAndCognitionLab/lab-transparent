#Minimizing Mistakes In Psychological Science

This repository contains text, analysis, and graphs of the manuscript *Minimizing Mistakes In Psychological Science* authored by Jeff Rouder, Julia Haaf, and Hope Snyder.

In this manuscript, we aim at providing guidance for developing and implementing best practices in organizing a psychology research lab, especially in the face of new cultural norms such as the open-science movement. Part of this challenge in today's landscape is using new technologies such as cloud storage and computer automation. Here we discuss a few practices designed to increase the reliability of scientific labs by focusing on what technologies and elements minimize common, ordinary mistakes. We borrow principles from the Theory of **High-Reliability Organizations** which has been used to characterize operational practices in high-risk environments such as aviation and healthcare. From these principles, we focus on five elements: 

1. implementing a lab culture focused on learning from mistakes; 

2. using computer automation in data and meta-data collection wherever possible; 

3. standardizing organization strategies; 

4. using coded rather than menu-driven analyses; 

5. developing expanded documents that record how analyses were performed.
